# MillaCubeRangeMod

A mod for the game [Freedom Planet 2](https://freedomplanet2.com/) which allows you to increase (or lower) the range of Milla's projectile and cube attack.  
By default the range is set to effectively infinite. Setting values higher than -50 might have unintended effects.  
Values can be only negative - the lower the number, the further cube will fly.  
Value can be set in the config file, generated on the first run in BepInEx/config.  

## Prerequisites:
