# MillaCubeRangeMod

Mod which allows you to increase (or lower) the range of Milla's projectile and cube attack.
By default the range is set to effectively infinite. Setting values higher than -50 might have unintended effects.
Values can be only negative - the lower the number, the further cube will fly.
Value can be set in the config file, generated on the first run in BepInEx/config.

Install:

    Install BepInEx 5 (Download) - extract the downloaded file into main game directory.
    Install the mod - extract the zipfile contents into the main game dir - (if asked, agree to merge the BepInEx folders).
